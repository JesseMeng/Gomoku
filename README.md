# Gomoku
Gomoku is my favourite old-school board game and it is the very first board game that I played.
I was really happy to implement this game. In the future, I plan to add the option of playing with the PC (although pvp is more fun!).
Please email me your feedback and suggestions at jesse@jessemeng.com!
