# Gomoku
Hey guys, gomoku is my favourite old-school board game and it is the very first board game that I played.
I was really happy to personalize my own version of this game and I hope you guys like it too!
In the future, I plan to add the option of playing with the PC (although pvp is more fun!).
If you guys have any feedback for me or would like to challenge me in this game, feel free to find my contact info at jessemeng.com :)
